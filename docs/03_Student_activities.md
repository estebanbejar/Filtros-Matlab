# Suggested student activities

This document proposes several activities that can be used in lab sessions or as homework, based on the three scripts:

- `selector_filtro.m`
- `filtro_butterworth_interactivo.m`
- `filtro_chebyshev_interactivo.m`

---

## Activity 1 – Basic Butterworth design

1. Use `selector_filtro` to open the Butterworth configurator.
2. Design a 4th-order low-pass filter with:
   - Sampling frequency: 8 kHz
   - Cutoff frequency: 1 kHz
3. Export the PNG.
4. Answer:
   - How many poles does the prototype have?
   - Where are they located in the s-plane (qualitatively: left half-plane, circle, etc.)?
   - Is the passband maximally flat? Check the magnitude response.

## Activity 2 – Comparing filter families

1. Design three 4th-order low-pass filters with the same nominal cutoff (1 kHz, Fs = 8 kHz):
   - Butterworth
   - Chebyshev type I (1 dB ripple)
   - Chebyshev type II (40 dB stopband attenuation)
2. For each one:
   - Save the PNG.
   - Compare magnitude and phase responses.
   - Compare the prototype s-plane diagrams.
3. Write a short summary:
   - Which filter has the steepest transition?
   - How does the passband ripple appear?
   - Which one would you choose for a typical audio application? Why?

## Activity 3 – Band-pass transformation and Sedra & Smith

1. Design a 4th-order Chebyshev type II **low-pass** prototype.
2. Then design a **band-pass** filter with:
   - Passband between 500 Hz and 1500 Hz (Fs = 8 kHz).
3. Compare:
   - The prototype pole–zero diagram.
   - The transformed band-pass pole–zero diagram.
4. Open the corresponding figure in Sedra & Smith (e.g. band-pass Chebyshev pole–zero diagram) and:
   - Identify the relationship between the prototype poles and the band-pass poles.
   - Explain why the imaginary parts become much larger in the band-pass case.
   - Comment on why it may not be convenient to force equal scaling on both axes (σ and jω).

## Activity 4 – From design to implementation

1. Design a 6th-order low-pass Butterworth filter at:
   - Fs = 10 kHz
   - Fc = 2 kHz
2. Copy the digital coefficients `b` and `a` to a new script.
3. Generate a test signal:
   - Sum of two sine waves: one at 1 kHz and one at 3 kHz.
4. Filter the signal and:
   - Plot the input and output signals.
   - Compute and plot their spectra.
5. Comment on:
   - Which component is attenuated?
   - Is the transition steep enough for this application?

## Activity 5 – Sensitivity to filter order

1. For Butterworth and Chebyshev (type I), design:
   - A 2nd-order low-pass filter
   - A 4th-order low-pass filter
   - An 8th-order low-pass filter
2. Compare:
   - Magnitude response (transition steepness).
   - Prototype pole locations (how do they cluster?).
3. Discuss:
   - Advantages and drawbacks of increasing the order (complexity, numerical issues, group delay).

These activities are intended to help students:

- Connect theoretical filter design with practical MATLAB implementation.
- Understand the geometric meaning of poles and zeros in the s-plane.
- Interpret textbook diagrams (e.g. Sedra & Smith) through concrete examples generated by the scripts.
